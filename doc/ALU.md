# Arithmetic and Logic Module and Register File

## Notes
During making the ALU and register file no specific issues where encountered, although I did have to reduce the warnings as Verilator was warning me about unconnected wires.
This is a necessity at this stage of the design process as the ALU only does one thing at the moment and does not need `ALUctrl`.
